Chewytracker keeps track of your calories.

## Assignment

Write an application for the input of calories

- User must be able to create an account and log in
- When logged in, user can see a list of his meals and calories (user enters calories manually, no auto calculations!), also he should be able to edit and delete
- Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.)
- Each entry has a date, time, text, and num of calories
- Filter by dates from-to, time from-to (e.g. how much calories have I had for lunch each day in the last month, if lunch is between 12 and 15h)
- User setting – Expected number of calories per day
- When displayed, it goes green if the total for that day is less than expected number of calories per day, otherwise goes red
- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
- All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this)
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Parse.com, Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
